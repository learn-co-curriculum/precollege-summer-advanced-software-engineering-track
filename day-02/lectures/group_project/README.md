## MVC Group Challenge - Lecture Notes

### Group Project
**Challenge:** Build your own social media clone!

**Group Size:** 3-4 students per group. Heterogeneous groups (mixing strong students with students that need more support). 

**Intro:**
Over the course of the next few classes, you'll be working groups to recreate the social media application of your choosing. Think of any application where a User posts content. The patterns that we learn with Fwitter should apply to this application as well. Some possibilities are:

+ Instagram
+ Snapchat
+ Tumblr
+ Blogspot
+ Yik Yak
+ Pinterest 

Consider this application a sandbox to practice the skills we're learning. Be prepared to rewrite code, break things, and make a lot of changes, and iterate as we continue to learn and improve. 

For this project, try to give each group member a chance to work on different parts of the application. 

**Presenting:**
After our fifth class, every group will present and every group member will go up to the front for the presentation. It's okay if your application isn't working - this is a sandbox, after all - but be prepared to talk about your code and the challenges that you faced while building the application. 

After presentations, there will be a time to ask each group questions about their project. Students should be guided to ask questions about the heart of each group’s design decisions and technical challenges.

**Best Practices:**
  + **Culture and Expectations**
    + Dealing with frustration, this is important.
    + Working together is the only way to build amazing things.
    + Importance to employers - the ability to collaborate and cooperate. This is the first thing that employers ask about. Employers don’t care if you’re a good coder if you can’t work together effectively.
    + Communication - What works (listening, thoughtful responses)
    + We are a coder COMMUNITY. We don’t put others down. We help and bring people up. And this goes for life, too.
    + Humility.

  + **Classroom Management**
    + Speak in terms of positive. A successful coder… Make it aspirational.
    + Positive reinforcement.
    + Relate to the real world.
    + 15 minute q & a with adult team or dev team to talk about collaboration and teamwork.

  + **Logistics**
    + Whiteboard tables, big screens
    + Rules around presentation. There is a time for questions, after the main presentations.
    + Make sure questions are appropriate (What is an appropriate question?)
    + Presentation guidelines (length, explain one technical thing, one design decision, etc..)

  + **Presentation of challenge**
    + Think about design decisions. There is no right or wrong. Just different ways of doing things, with tradeoffs…
    + We are empowering you to prioritize, so obviously you won’t be able to do everything.
    + There should be some modeling out as a group before the challenge.
    + Before coding starts there should be discussion of goals and a project plan.

  + **Implementation**
    + Rotating
    + After project is done, positive feedback is given. Anonymous or not?
