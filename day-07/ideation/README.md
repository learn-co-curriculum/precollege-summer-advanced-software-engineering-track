# Ideation - Lecture Notes


###Ideation Day

Show examples of ineresting web utilities
Examples:
Real World Apps:
https://validator.w3.org/
Google Translate
astrologyzone.com
These apps or utilities are really just
How these sites work (like Google translate): User input => modified by a process => custom output
This is exactly what we learned in day 1 with puts and gets - input output powers the web
Here are some things our kids have built using that methodology
Student Examples:
Clarence and Fiona: http://breaking-as.herokuapp.com/
Caroline: monogram-maker.herokuapp.com
Malachi and Jovan: http://which-fruit-are-you.herokuapp.com


Solicit examples -- use examples to highlight whats not possible (eg. yes fb is like this except it has a db..)
Ask students for their ideas of this what websites do this - points us right towards constraints
Introduce Constraints
Scope & Constraint:
You’ll have to build it up!
can’t persist data - What is means to persist data
can’t store data a user enter, every time you go to a site, it’s the same experience (like your fb wall is different every time)
Can’t upload files
can’t bring in data from other things

Exercise: Imposing Constraints

WHY impose constraints 
It is a bit counterintuitive, but imposing constraints with intention can actually increase your creative potential. Try it: Think of as many white things as you can in ten seconds. Now think of white things in your kitchen. Did the more constrained prompt spark more ideas?

Why HOW MIGHT WE

“How might we” (HMW) questions are short questions that launch brainstorms. HMWs are seeds for your ideation that fall out of your point-of-view statement, design principles, or insights.
 Create a seed that is broad enough that there are a wide range of solutions but narrow enough that the team is provoked to think of specific, unique ideas. For example, between the (possibly) too narrow “HMW create a cone to eat ice cream without dripping” and the too broad “HMW redesign dessert” might be the properly scoped “HMW redesign ice cream to be more portable.” 
It should be noted, the the proper scope of the seed will vary with the project and how much progress you have made in your project work. 
How to generate HOW MIGHT WE questions

Begin with your Point of View (POV), insights, or problem statement. Create small actionable questions that retain your unique and specific perspective. Write these questions beginning with the phrase, “How might we…” It is often helpful to brainstorm the HMW questions before the solutions brainstorm. For example, consider the following POV and resulting HMW statements. 

Challenge: Redesign the ground experience at the local international airport POV: Harried mother of three, rushing through the airport only to wait hours at the gate, needs to entertain her playful children because “annoying little brats” only irritate already frustrated fellow passengers. 

Amp up the good: HMW use the kids’ energy to entertain fellow passenger? Remove the bad: HMW separate the kids from fellow passengers? 
Explore the opposite: HMW make the wait the most exciting part of the trip? Question an assumption: HMW entirely remove the wait time at the airport? 
Go after adjectives: HMW we make the rush refreshing instead of harrying? 
ID unexpected resources: HMW leverage free time of fellow passengers to share the load? 
Create an analogy from need or context: HMW make the airport like a spa? Like a playground? 
Play against the challenge: HMW make the airport a place that kids want to go? Change a status quo: HMW make playful, loud kids less annoying? 
Break POV into pieces: HMW entertain kids? HMW slow a mom down? HMW mollify delayed passengers? 

Facilitating the HOW MIGHT WE exercise

##WHY facilitate a brainstorm 
Good facilitation is key to a generative brainstorm. You brainstorm to come up with many, wide-ranging ideas; a good facilitator sets the stage for the team to be successful doing this. 

##HOW to facilitate brainstorm
ENERGY – As the facilitator it is your task to keep the ideas flowing. Perhaps the most important aspect of a successful brainstorm is the seed question that you are brainstorming about (see the “How Might We” method card for more information). During the brainstorm keep a pulse on the energy of the group. If the group is slowing down or getting stuck, make an adjustment. Create a variation to the “How-might-we?” (HMW) statement to get the group thinking in another direction (prepare some HMW options ahead of time). Or have a few provocative ideas in your back pocket that you can lob in to re-energize the team.
CONSTRAINTS – Add constraints that may spark new ideas. “What if it had to be round?,” “How would superman do it?,” “How would your spouse design it?,” “How would you design it with the technology of 100 years ago?” Additionally you can create process constraints. Try putting a time limit on each howmight-we statement; shoot for 50 ideas in 20 minutes. 
SPACE – Be mindful about the space in which you conduct a brainstorm. Make sure that there is plenty of vertical writing area. This allows the group to generate a large number of potential solutions. Strike a balance between having a footprint that is big enough for everyone, but also is not so large that some people start to feel removed. A good rule of thumb is that all members of the group should be able to reach the board in two steps. Also, make sure each person has access to sticky notes and a marker so they can capture their own thoughts and add them to the board if the scribe cannot keep up with the pace. (See more about scribing on the “Brainstorming” method card.)

The problem is something you have a personal connection to or care a lot about
The customer is someone who is easily accessible (both in-person close to the school and online)
