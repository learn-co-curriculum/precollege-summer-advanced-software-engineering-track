## Motivation
![Web APIs](https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/API.png)
Think about how many cool apps there are out there: Instagram, Yelp, Yumly, Foursquare, Spotify (etc). There are a million; too many to list. All of these apps have a way for you to sign up and interact with the application. With Instagram, you can upload photos, search hashtags, and look at all the photos tagged in a specific location. 

In the same way that you can interact with an application, a program can as well. API stands for "Application Programming Interface". In a nutshell, an API is a set of instructions that allows developers to change and control existing web applications. It's a way for the developers of existing applications to allow other people to get their data in a controlled way. For example, the Facebook API has a specific function that allows developers to integrate posting to a Facebook wall. The Twitter API has a function that allows developers to display all of a user's tweets.And New York City provides tons of data about the city through it's Open Data API.
