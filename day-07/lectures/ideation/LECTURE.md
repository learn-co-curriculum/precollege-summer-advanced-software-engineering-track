# Ideation - Full Lecture


###Ideation Day

1. Show examples of ineresting web applications that utilize basic data persistence

Examples:
Real World Apps:

"These apps or persist data in order to present a custom, dynamic experience to the user.  
2. How these sites work (like Google translate): User input => Fetch custom data => manipulate data => custom output
3. This is exactly what we have been learning.  Active record gives us tremendous power to store data, and our MVC framework gives us the ability to manipulate it and display it in a cusotm way.  Additionally, you've learned that APIs are really just an interface to access a particular data set.  With APIs, you can substitute stored data for dynamically retrieving it.

4. Here are some things our kids have built using that methodology
Student Examples:

5. Constraints
The problem is something you have a personal connection to or care a lot about
The customer is someone who is easily accessible (both in-person close to the school and online)
(White things vs. white things in a kitchen exercise to illustrate power of constraints)

6. Ideate

How-Might-We Exercise: Students learn how asking the right questions can inspire powerful ideation (60 minutes)

Why HOW MIGHT WE

“How might we” (HMW) questions are short questions that launch brainstorms. HMWs are seeds for your ideation that fall out of your point-of-view statement, design principles, or insights.
 Create a seed that is broad enough that there are a wide range of solutions but narrow enough that the team is provoked to think of specific, unique ideas. For example, between the (possibly) too narrow “HMW create a cone to eat ice cream without dripping” and the too broad “HMW redesign dessert” might be the properly scoped “HMW redesign ice cream to be more portable.” 
It should be noted, that the proper scope of the seed will vary with the project and how much progress you have made in your project work. 
How to generate HOW MIGHT WE questions

Begin with your Point of View (POV), insights, or problem statement. Create small actionable questions that retain your unique and specific perspective. Write these questions beginning with the phrase, “How might we…” It is often helpful to brainstorm the HMW questions before the solutions brainstorm. For example, consider the following POV and resulting HMW statements. 

Challenge: Redesign the ground experience at the local international airport POV: Harried mother of three, rushing through the airport only to wait hours at the gate, needs to entertain her playful children because “annoying little brats” only irritate already frustrated fellow passengers. 

Amp up the good: HMW use the kids’ energy to entertain fellow passenger? Remove the bad: HMW separate the kids from fellow passengers? 
Explore the opposite: HMW make the wait the most exciting part of the trip? Question an assumption: HMW entirely remove the wait time at the airport? 
Go after adjectives: HMW we make the rush refreshing instead of harrying? 
ID unexpected resources: HMW leverage free time of fellow passengers to share the load? 
Create an analogy from need or context: HMW make the airport like a spa? Like a playground? 
Play against the challenge: HMW make the airport a place that kids want to go? Change a status quo: HMW make playful, loud kids less annoying? 
Break POV into pieces: HMW entertain kids? HMW slow a mom down? HMW mollify delayed passengers? 

Facilitating the HOW MIGHT WE exercise

###How to facilitate brainstorm
1. ENERGY – As the facilitator it is your task to keep the ideas flowing. Perhaps the most important aspect of a successful brainstorm is the seed question that you are brainstorming about  D
CONSTRAINTS – Add constraints that may spark new ideas. “What if it had to be round?,” “How would superman do it?,” “How would your spouse design it?,” “How would you design it with the technology of 100 years ago?” Additionally you can create process constraints. Try putting a time limit on each howmight-we statement; shoot for 50 ideas in 20 minutes. 
SPACE – Be mindful about the space in which you conduct a brainstorm. Make sure that there is plenty of vertical writing area. This allows the group to generate a large number of potential solutions. Strike a balance between having a footprint that is big enough for everyone, but also is not so large that some people start to feel removed. A good rule of thumb is that all members of the group should be able to reach the board in two steps. Also, make sure each person has access to sticky notes and a marker so they can capture their own thoughts and add them to the board if the scribe cannot keep up with the pace.
