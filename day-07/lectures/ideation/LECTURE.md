# Ideation - Full Lecture


##Ideation Day

###SWABTs
+ Understand the brainstorming and design process and decide on an idea for their final project.

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ We’ve all been in the situation where we want to make something, but are totally overwhelmed by the blank page. The blinking cursor of nothingness. It’s totally daunting. Since we’re going to start working on our final projects, we’re going to first tackle the brainstorming process so that we have a few potential projects that we can work on. The point of this course is to learn to build web applications, combining front-end programming with back-end programming, but you can't build an application about nothing. You need a good idea, first!

+ You've spent a good chunk of your summer learning MVC — the architecture that supports most applications that you use, love, or have ever intereacted with.  You hold enormous power in your hands!  Combing the front-end ad backend, with the ability to store data or retrieve it through an API.  sIn order for you to use this power effectively, let's dive into a brainstorming process.  Some of you already have final project ideas — that's cool.  Take this opportunity to refine them.

###Lesson Plan

1. Show examples of ineresting web applications that utilize basic data persistence.
+ Examples:
  + http://www.data.gov/
  + NYC Open data: https://nycopendata.socrata.com/

2. Here are some things our kids have built using that methodology
Student Examples:

3. Constraints
  + The problem is something you have a personal connection to or care a lot about
  + The customer is someone who is easily accessible (both in-person close to the school and online)
  + Illustrate power of constraints: (Think of as many White things in 10 seconds vs. white things in a kitchen )

4. Ideate (~1h)
  #### Problem brainstorm:
  + On the board, create four categories: Friends and family, School, Community, World. 
  + Have students write down as many ideas as possible on post-it notes for three minutes for each of the following segments:
      + What are some problems you experience with your friends or family?
      + What are some problems you experience at school?
      + What are some problems you experience in your community (city)?
      + What are some problems you want to address in the world?
  + Following each segment, have the students take their post-its up to the board.  Have them take 10 minutes to  organize into teams around a problem they find interesting.
  #### Solution brainstorm
    + Once students are organized into groups, have them clarify who their end-user will be.  Who are they building this app for? How do they currently solve this problem?  What are the shortcomings of current solutions? Have each group share their use case.
    + Have students take 3 minutes to write down as many solutions to their groups problems as possible individually.
    + If teams of 4 have students partner up and take an additional 3 minutes to share and refine ideas.
    + Have teams come together and share ideas and pick their favorite solution. 
5. Refine
  + Have students take 15 minutes to refine their idea.
  + Have students write out three clear use cases for their app/solution.


###Hints and Hurdles 
1. ENERGY – As the facilitator it is your task to keep the ideas flowing. Perhaps the most important aspect of a successful brainstorm is the seed question that you are brainstorming about  D
2. CONSTRAINTS – Add constraints that may spark new ideas. “What if it had to be round?,” “How would superman do it?,” “How would your spouse design it?,” “How would you design it with the technology of 100 years ago?” Additionally you can create process constraints. Try putting a time limit on each howmight-we statement; shoot for 50 ideas in 20 minutes. 
3. SPACE – Be mindful about the space in which you conduct a brainstorm. Make sure that there is plenty of vertical writing area. This allows the group to generate a large number of potential solutions. Strike a balance between having a footprint that is big enough for everyone, but also is not so large that some people start to feel removed. A good rule of thumb is that all members of the group should be able to reach the board in two steps. Also, make sure each person has access to sticky notes and a marker so they can capture their own thoughts and add them to the board if the scribe cannot keep up with the pace. 
4. MUSIC - Play upbeat music during all steps while participants work, and turn it down to give instruction.
5. TIME - Be assertive in keeping time limits tight.
